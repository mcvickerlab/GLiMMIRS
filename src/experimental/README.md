### Summary
This folder contains all of the scripts required to reproduce the GLiMMIRS analysis of the Gasperini et al. dataset.

### Step 1: Download Gasperini Data
The script for downloading the data can be found in this folder at ```data/download_experimental_data.sh```

The data for the Gasperini et al. analysis was downloaded from two sources: GEO and the website of the paper. The covariates, gene expression matrix, and at-scale differential expression analysis results were downloaded from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120861). The high confidence enhancer-gene pairs from the Gasperini et al. analysis were analyzed using Supplementary Table 2, which can be downloaded from the Cell website. 

Note: The file paths may need to be adjusted.
