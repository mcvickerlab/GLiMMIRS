     ‘ggsave()’ is a convenient function for saving a plot. It defaults
     to saving the last plot that you displayed, using the size of the
     current graphics device. It also guesses the type of graphics
     device from the extension.

filename: File name to create on disk.

    plot: Plot to save, defaults to last plot displayed.

  device: Device to use. Can either be a device function (e.g. png), or
          one of "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex), "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff",
          "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only).

    path: Path of the directory to save plot to: ‘path’ and ‘filename’
          are combined to create the fully qualified file name.
          Defaults to the working directory.

   scale: Multiplicative scaling factor.

width, height, units: Plot size in ‘units’ ("in", "cm", "mm", or "px").
          If not supplied, uses the size of current graphics device.

     dpi: Plot resolution. Also accepts a string input: "retina" (320),
          "print" (300), or "screen" (72). Applies only to raster
          output types.

limitsize: When ‘TRUE’ (the default), ‘ggsave()’ will not save images
          larger than 50x50 inches, to prevent the common error of
          specifying dimensions in pixels.

      bg: Background colour. If ‘NULL’, uses the ‘plot.background’ fill
          value from the plot theme.

     ...: Other arguments passed on to the graphics device function, as
          specified by ‘device’.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Note: Filenames with page numbers can be generated by including a
     C integer format expression, such as %03d (as in the default file
     name for most R graphics devices, see e.g. ‘png()’). Thus,
     ‘filename = "figure%03d.png"’ will produce successive filenames
     ‘figure001.png’, ‘figure002.png’, ‘figure003.png’, etc. To write a
     filename containing the % sign, use ‘%%’. For example, ‘filename =
     "figure-100%%.png"’ will produce the filename figure-100%.png.

     In most cases ‘ggsave()’ is the simplest way to save your plot,
     but sometimes you may wish to save the plot by writing directly to
     a graphics device. To do this, you can open a regular R graphics
     device such as ‘png()’ or ‘pdf()’, print the plot, and then close
     the device using ‘dev.off()’. This technique is illustrated in the
     examples section.
