# GLiMMIRS (**G**eneralized **Li**near **M**odels for **M**easuring **I**nteractions between **R**egulatory **S**equences) âœ¨

Our paper **Genome-wide analysis of CRISPR perturbations indicates that enhancers act multiplicatively and without epistatic-like interactions** is now available as a preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.26.538501v1)! Check it out!

This repo contains scripts that demonstrate the data simulation and model fitting functionalities of GLiMMIRS. We have provided tutorials for running our scripts as well as Jupyter notebooks that visualize simulated data and walk the user through the outputs of our scripts and how to interact with them.
